We spent most of the day fixing getObjectAt in the World class as we had problems regarding the differenciation between super class of an object and the actual class, like fruit and orange. Additionally, We had to figure out how the path for images as we had a lot of problems with that in the Arcade Engine Homeworks. Additionally, as a group we brainstormed various games such as jetpack joyride, flappy bird and fruit ninja and finally decided on Fruit Ninja as it can be made as complex as we feel comfortable handling.

I went home and made the README file and the google document for your Game. I started thinking about the classes that I would need and the features that I want to add.

In class, I couldn't find a good sprite for a pomegranate online, so I experimented with making my own sprites. Though I was a sun experience It was time consuming and the result was not optimal. While We will use my sprite in the game, I would try to find stripes online from now.

We had significant issues with out fruit spawning which all fixed to together on one computer as GitHub was not working. We ending up fixing spawning and started on the freeze powerup.

I started work on the Knife of the game. Since it is quite integral to the game I spent a lot of time perfecting it. I ran into an issue when act was too slow to handle the knife so I thought creatively and made use of the onMove functions.

I worked on the cutting logic behind the food and ran into a problem where the knife kept cutting every act. Eventually I was able to fix the bug on the same day.

Today, I created the cutFruit class for when the knife cuts the fruit and the fruit splits into 2. I had a lot of issues with making the class adaptable for all scenarios while maintaining functionality. Additionally I found some sprites for cut fruits which took more than 30 minutes.

Today, I worked with eric on finding and editing different splats for a splash after the fruit is cut. It is purely costemic but makes the game more like the original. Additionally I updated the readme to be more current.

Today I fixed bugs in the TestWorld class and organized all the files within the game. The images really cluttered up the program and made it hard to work with.

Today I went through many iterations of testing regarding the shaking of the background. I was contemplating on whether to move the background or rotate it. I settled with move however it was too complex so I rotated it.

Today I added a start screen with instructions on how to play, a start button and a logo. Additionally, I thought our physics were cumbersome to work with and cause errors in calculating strikes so I fixed it.

Today I spend a lot of time making instructions page on Canva for the game. Though I have experience with canva, It is had to remove background and fix the errors that it caused. Addtionally, I updated many names to keep the project organized and created multiple gamemode select options for some vareity.

Today I finished basic code for all 3 new gamemodes, infinite, multiplayer and timed. I had to make unique end screen for each one and figure out when each would end. The multiplayer idea was ambitious and went through many fixed until I ended with one player throwing fruit and the other cutting with it never ending and a back button to finish.

Today I added a font that fits the theme of the project. I had a lot of trouble selecting and adding the font to the code. First I used InputStream which requires an absolute path which was not common among all the group memebers and it finally worked when I used the File class instead. Also I added statistics for all the different game modes and added an option to go back to the main menu so that a different mode can be played. Also, Me and Naman worked on sound effects together and had a tough time selecting good ones that fix our project.
